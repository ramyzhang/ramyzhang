ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ramyzhang, currently a 3rd year studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and [games](https://mimimosa.itch.io/)! One of my favourite things in the world is realizing an abstract idea into delightful software that people can engage with.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OpenGL and audio programming with JUCE!

ðŸ”¬ My biggest project at the moment is co-leading the development of this [lesson planner tool](https://github.com/uoftblueprint/sistema) for Sistema Toronto, a non-profit for early childhood music education!

ðŸ“« Check out my [personal website](https://ramyzhang.com/) to learn more about me!
