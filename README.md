### Hello! 👋 

👩🏻‍💻 I’m a 3rd year studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto!

👀 I love [game development](https://mimimosa.itch.io/)!

🌱 I’m currently learning about the basics of machine learning (parametric models currently and eventually, unsupervised and reinforcement learning)!

🎶 My biggest project at the moment is co-leading the development of a [lesson planner tool](https://github.com/uoftblueprint/sistema) on iOS/Android (React Native) for Sistema Toronto, an early childhood music education non-profit.

📫 Check out my [personal website](https://ramyzhang.com/) to learn more about me!
