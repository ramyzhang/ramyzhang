### Hello! 👋 

👩🏻‍💻 I’m a 2024 New Grad who studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto! 

💼 Currently working as a Software Developer Intern at CGI, but looking for opportunities at game studios as an engineer or audio programmer!

👀 I love [game development](https://mimimosa.itch.io/)! Realizing something that was just a fun idea into a virtual world that people can fall into and play in is one of the best feelings ever.

🎶 My biggest project so far was co-leading the development of a [lesson planner tool](https://github.com/uoftblueprint/sistema) on iOS/Android (React Native) for Sistema Toronto, an early childhood music education non-profit.
