### Hi hi hello! 👋 

👩🏻‍💻 I’m a 3rd year studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto!

👀 I love web development and [game development](https://mimimosa.itch.io/). One of my favourite things in the world to do is realizing ideas into delightful software that people can engage with.

🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL in my Computer Graphics course!

🎶 My biggest project at the moment is co-leading the development of this [lesson planner tool](https://github.com/uoftblueprint/sistema) for Sistema Toronto, a non-profit for early childhood music education.

📫 Check out my [personal website](https://ramyzhang.com/) to learn more about me!
